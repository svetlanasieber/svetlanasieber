 I'm a true Computer Enthusiast with a burning passion for Embedded Systems and the Latest Technologies.

Currently, I am diving deep into the realm of Artificial Intelligence, exploring its exciting Applications in Robotics and low-level hardware programming.
  AI is used to enhance the autonomous capabilities of robots, including sensor data processing, navigation, object recognition, and real-time decision making.

ðŸ”§ My strength lies in Embedded Linux Programming, where I've harnessed the Yocto Project to create solutions that are both powerful and highly efficient. 
Additionally, I possess extensive experience in programming various Microcontrollers, further enriching my expertise in Embedded systems and allowing for a versatile approach in Hardware-software integration.

I love exploring new horizons and applying theory into practice, turning complex concepts into real, functional projects.
