Hi, I'm Svetlana Sieber! ðŸ‘‹

I have been in the IT industry for 23 years. For the past 16 years, I have primarily worked as a freelancer with various companies from all around the world. My specialization has been in Unix programming and deployment. Currently, I am expanding my skills by studying new technologies at Software University."

I am unable to showcase projects I've completed for various companies and clients due to confidentiality agreements. However, I will periodically publish my personal projects and assignments from my studies at Software University

Programming is my passion. I thrive on tackling challenging tasks and cases, even if they are time-consuming. The joy for me lies in resolving complex projects
